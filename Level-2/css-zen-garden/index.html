            <p>A demonstration of what can be accomplished through <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>-based
                design. Select any style sheet from the
                list to load it into this page.</p>

            <p>Download the example <a href="?" title="This page's source HTML code, not to be modified.">html file</a>

            <h3>THE ROAD TO ENLIGHTENMENT</h3>

            <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible <abbr
                    title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>s, broken <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
                support, and abandoned browsers.</p>

            <p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless
                efforts of folk like the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>, <abbr
                    title="Web Standards Project">WaSP</abbr>, and the major browser creators.</p>

            <p>The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters. Begin
                to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion.
                Become one with the web.</p>

            <h3>SO WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?</h3>

            <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. The
                Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing
                designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very page. The <abbr
                    title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> remains the same, the only thing that has changed
                is the external <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file. Yes, really.</p>

            <p><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> allows complete and total control over the style of a
                hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by
                demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create
                beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can
                always push it further.</p>

            <h3>PARTICIPATION</h3>

            <p>Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so strong <abbr
                    title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> skills are necessary too, but the example files are
                commented well enough that even <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> novices can use them
                as starting points. Please see the <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/resources/"
                    title="A listing of CSS-related resources"><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
                    Resource Guide</a> for advanced tutorials and tips on working with <abbr
                    title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.</p>
            <p>You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the <abbr
                    title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. This may seem daunting at first if you've
                never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as
                a guide.</p>
            <p>Download the sample <a href="?"
                    title="This page's source HTML code, not to be modified.">HTML</a> and <a href="?"
                    title="This page's sample CSS, the file you may modify.">CSS</a> to
                work on a copy locally. Once you have completed your masterpiece (and please, don't submit
                half-finished work) upload your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file to a web server
                under your control. <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/submit/"
                    title="Use the contact form to send us your CSS file">Send us a link</a> to an archive of that
                file and all associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will download it and place it on our
                server.</p>

            <h3>BENEFITS</h3>

            <p>Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all refer to showing people how
                amazing CSS really can be. This site serves as equal parts inspiration for those working on the web
                today, learning tool for those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future techniques we can all look
                forward to.</p>

            <h1>REQUIREMENTS</h1>
            <p>Where possible, we would like to see mostly CSS 1 & 2 usage. CSS 3 & 4 should be limited to
                widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about
                functional, practical CSS and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public.
                The only real requirement we have is that your CSS validates.</p>

            <p>Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented CSS by now. When sticking to
                the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer
                number of user agents on the web these days — especially when you factor in mobile — pixel-perfect
                layouts may not be possible across every platform. That’s okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your
                design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by
                over 90% of the population).</p>

            <p>We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable
                material to a minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We’re
                well past the point of needing another garden-related design.</p>

            <p>This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright on your graphics (with
                limited exceptions, see submission guidelines), but we ask you release your CSS under a Creative Commons
                license identical to the one on this site so that others may learn from your work.</p>
