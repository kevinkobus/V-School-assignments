        Hi-ho, I'm a frontend pond dweller here, with a particular interest in
        playing the bango and singing happy tunes. I enjoy collaborating with
        other Muppets on freelance projects, songs, movies, and many other
        things. It ain't easy being green but I'm always looking for new things
        to learn.
